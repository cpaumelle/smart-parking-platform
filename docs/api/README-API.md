# Smart Parking API â€” Implementation-Synced Spec

This spec mirrors the current implementation (v5.3) with **implicit tenant scoping**:
- Paths do **not** include `/tenants/{tenant_id}`; tenant is derived from auth.
- Endpoints present here are those that exist in code today per the compliance report.
